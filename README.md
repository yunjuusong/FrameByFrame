Make sure your Github repo has a valid README that describes how to install and run the tool locally on your computer, including dependencies/libraries that need to be installed if they are not included already with the repo (e.g., aren’t covered by NPM or aren’t static .js files that already exist in the repo).

Welcome to Frame by Frame!

* Open a terminal window. Run the following commands in order: 
        cd backend
